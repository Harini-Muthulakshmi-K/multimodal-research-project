# Multimodal Entity Recognition and Relation Extraction

This repository will contain a PyTorch implementation of the paper:
"Multimodal Entity Recognition and Relation Extraction via Dynamic Visual-Textual Enhanced Fusion".

The goal is to reproduce the architecture and extend it with explainability.
